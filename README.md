## Deployed Dogs vs Cats Classifier using Streamlit
</n>

This project uses the model from the [Dogs-vs-Cats Classifier](https://github.com/prithvimk/dogs-vs-cats) and deploys it as a web-app using the Streamlit service.

The main.py file contains the Front-End Streamlit code and uses the helper.py file to load the model and make predictions based on the uploaded image.

Run the web app on your browser by running the command:

```streamlit run main.py```
